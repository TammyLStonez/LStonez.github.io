In the heart of Nigeria, amidst the bustling streets of Abuja, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu sat in the quietude of the presidential villa, pondering over a decision that would soon ripple across the nation. It was a decision rooted in history, culture, and a deep sense of patriotism.

The Reintroduction

The old national anthem, “Nigeria, We Hail Thee,” had been a symbol of the country’s rich heritage, composed during a time of hope and unity. As President Tinubu reflected on the words penned by Lillian Jean Williams and the melody composed by Frances Berda, he felt a stirring within him—a desire to reconnect with the past and reignite the spirit of unity it represented.

The Decision

With the stroke of a pen and the weight of history on his shoulders, President Tinubu signed the bill that would bring back the old anthem. It was a bold move, one that he knew would be met with mixed emotions. Some would embrace the change, seeing it as a nod to Nigeria’s storied past. Others would question the timing, pointing to the pressing issues of the present.

The Reaction

The news spread like wildfire, igniting conversations in homes, on the streets, and across the digital landscape. Outrage, support, and everything in between poured out from the hearts of Nigerians. Some saw it as a distraction, while others viewed it as a step towards fostering a renewed sense of national identity1.

The Legacy

As the dust settled and the new-old anthem echoed through the halls of schools and the fields of play, President Tinubu knew that his legacy would be intertwined with this decision. Whether it would be seen as a masterstroke or a misstep, only time would tell. But one thing was certain: the anthem, with its solemn call to “Nigeria, We Hail Thee,” would continue to resonate with the people, a testament to their enduring resilience and hope for a united future.









The lyrics of the old national anthem of Nigeria, titled “Nigeria, We Hail Thee,” are as follows:

Stanza 1: Nigeria we hail thee, Our own dear native land, Though tribe and tongue may differ, In brotherhood we stand, Nigerians all, and proud to serve Our sovereign Motherland.

Stanza 2: Our flag shall be a symbol That truth and justice reign, In peace or battle honour’d, And this we count as gain, To hand on to our children A banner without stain.

Stanza 3: O God of all creation, Grant this our one request, Help us to build a nation Where no man is oppressed, And so with peace and plenty Nigeria may be blessed.

This anthem was composed by Lillian Jean Williams and the music was set by Frances Berda. It was adopted in 1960 during Nigeria’s independence and was in use until 1978
